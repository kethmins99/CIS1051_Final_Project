# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
# For my final project, I would like to try and create a website homepage that would act as a workspace for working on various tasks. I want to add a space for creating a to-do list, a space to embed a spotify playlist to listen to while working, a space for writing down any notes, and maybe a space for a pomodoro timer. I would like to give the user the option to choose a virtual background for their workspace (a video of a fireplace or a forest for example) and these different backgrounds will be my sub-pages.

TODO

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
# I am planning on working by myself 

TODO

## Do you have any questions of your own?
# I know from reading through the website track on Canvas that I would have to use JavaScript, CSS, and HTML for this project. However, I was wondering how I should integrate Python into the creation of my webpage.
