The biggest challenge that I overcame doing this project was learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a relatively short amount of time. However, once I did learn, I really enjoyed using CSS to style my website and I also enjoyed being able to learn how to add various features to my website. I am really glad that I learned these languages and am excited to use them in the future to build other websites. 
I am really glad that I was able to complete almost everything that I included in my proposal, and am happy that I was able to figure out how to save user entered notes as I was not sure if I would be able to do this with the knowledge that I had. Although I first wanted to do this using cookies, I found it much easier to use localstorage so this is what I ended up using. However, I would like to learn how to use cookies in the future. 

Overall, I really enjoyed completing this project and I think I learned a lot from it. I definitely enjoy using productivity websites especially during finals week and am hopeful that my website could be useful to other people too.
