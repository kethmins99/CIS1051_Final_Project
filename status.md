Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?
#### I have made the homepage for my website, linked it to other pages within my website with each page corresponding to a different theme. I have embedded a spotify playlist to each theme and added a section where a user can take notes and save the notes they have taken at the end of their session. I have also added a button that allows the user to retrieve these saved notes.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?
#### I have to add these features to all the themes within my website and I would like to make some stylistic changes to make my website look nicer. 

TODO

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
#### The biggest challenge was learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as there was definitely a learning curve. Another challenge I encountered was figuring out how to save the notes that a user entered after the browser was closed. Although I first wanted to do this using cookies, I ended up using localStorage and I found this much easier.
