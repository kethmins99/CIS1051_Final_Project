# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
## Productivity Planner 
TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
## A website that acts as a virtual workspace where the user can select the theme for their workspace, listen to music while working, take notes, and create todo lists. 
TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
## My website will allow a user to navigate through webpages to select the theme of their workspace. Within the selected theme, it will allow the user to create todo lists, take down notes, and listen to music through a spotify playlist embedded into the website. The webpages will be interactive, which will allow the user to add items to their to-do list and check them off. I will use JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to build my webpage and to add the necessary features to the webpage. My goal is to build a workspace online that integrates various productivity tools into one webpage,  giving the user the option of what theme they want to work in.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
### Build a homepage that leads to other webpages with themes to select from. A good outcome would be for each theme to have at least one of the features listed previously (todo list, playlist, or notes)

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
### A better outcome would be for each webpage to have two features (ideally a to-do list and an embedded spotify playlist) and for information entered to be saved if the browser were to be closed. 

TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
### The best outcome would be for each theme (webpage) to have a to-do list, spotify playlist, and notes section along with a pomodoro timer. Have mobile formatting. Allowing the user to save their information. 

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
## I will first need to learn JavaScript, CSS, and HTML in order to code the various features within my webpage. Then, I will create a basic homepage which will lead to my other webpages consisting of the various themes a user could choose from. Once I have added at least one feature to each theme, I will work on adding more details to my initial homepage. After I am done with my main homepage and all the other fundamental parts of my website, I will work on adding more features to each theme. I will need to research how to build a basic webpage using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, how to link to other webpages from a homepage, how to create themes for these webpages, and how to add various interactive features to my webpages.
